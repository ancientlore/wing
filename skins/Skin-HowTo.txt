How To Create Wing Skins
------------------------

To create a skin, create a background image and an INI file in the skins
directory.  To test your skin view it in the skin chooser. The chooser
will reload the ini file each time you select it in the chooser, making
it easy to refesh.

The Wing window will be as large as the bitmap you choose. Transparency
is also supported so that you can have non-rectangular windows. The skin's
INI file determines where the text and graph is positioned and what colors
and fonts are used. You may choose different settings depending on whether
the ping time is normal, a warning, or an error condition. These
conditions depend on the value you use for the maximum graph setting.

The INI file may contain the following sections.

[General]
	Contains general skin settings.
	Notes
		Notes about the skin displayed in the skin chooser.
	Credits
		Gives credit to the skin creator in the skin chooser.
	ClearType
		Can be 0 or -1; usually used to disable ClearType by setting it
		to 0. Some skins look better with ClearType off.

[Background]
	Defines the background images. The Wing window will be as large as
	the bitmap.
	Bitmap
		Bitmap filename. GIF, JPG, or BMP are recommended.
	TransparentColor
		The color of the bitmap used to represent transparency, in hex like
		0xFF00FF. This allows you to create non-rectangular Wing windows
		with transparent sections. Your bitmap needs to contain a totally
		uniform color for the transparent areas.

[RoundTripTime], [WarningRoundTripTime], [ErrorRoundTripTime]
[Description], [WarningDescription], [ErrorDescription]
	Defines how the ping time and description are displayed. Each section
	represents a different condition based on how long the ping took to
	respond.
	Show
		0 to hide display or 1 to show.
	X
		X position of the text. This is sensitive to Align.
	Y
		Y position of text. This is sensitive to Align.
	Color
		Font color in hex.
	ShadowColor
		Shadow color in hex or -1 to disable.
	ReflectColor
		Hilight color in hex or -1 to disable.
	Font
		Font name
	Size
		Font size in points.
	Bold
		1 for bold or 0 for normal.
	Italic
		1 for italic or 0 for normal.
	Angle
		Font angle in tenths of a degree. For example, 90 degress would be 900.
	Align
		Text alignment (left, center, right).

[Graph]
	Defines how the graph is drawn.
	Show
		1 to show or 0 to hide.
	Left
		Leftmost position.
	Right
		Rightmost position.
	Top
		Topmost position.
	Bottom
		Bottommost position.
	Style
		Graph style. Horizontal or vertical graphs supported.
	ShadowColor
		Shadow color in hex or -1 to disable shadow.
	Color
		Color for a normal ping time in hex.
	WarningColor
		Color for a warning ping time in hex.
	ErrorColor
		Color for a error ping time in hex.

Good luck!
